    "Linx Impulse (previsously Linx+Neemu+Chaordic) is atop the world of e-commerce, delivering to each user a unique and personalized experience while shopping online. We have the biggest database of behavioral data of the Latam market and we use it to build amazing products that deliver product recommendations, search results and targetted newsletters to millions of people everyday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Data Scientists are on a mission to increment company value by applying statistics and machine learning techniques to our vast sea of data. We are looking for someone who can generate story from data and is willing to work in all stages of our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be the go-to person when it comes to product performance analysis and insights generation. Focusing exclusively on understanding the underlying mechanisms of how decisions can affect conversion, lift and other KPIs in our product suite. This is a position of high intra-company visibility since it requires frequent reporting to managers, directors and heads of all teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, you have to prove yourself capable by overcoming this coding challenge. Since this is an opening for an intern position, we rely more on the potential shown in your solutions than on your CV to judge the candidates. So, do your best and good work!"
